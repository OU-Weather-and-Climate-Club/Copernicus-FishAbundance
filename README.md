# Fish abundance and catch data for the Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea
[copernicus.eu](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-fisheries-abundance?tab=overview)

----

The dataset contains model projections of fish catch and abundance in European seas out to 2098 produced using the Size Spectra – Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model (SS-DBEM). The SS-DBEM is a mechanistic model, which means that it takes into account aspects of ecology (e.g. habitat preference, migration) and physiology (e.g. growth and reproduction) to determine biomass and distribution of fish species in response to changes in the environment (e.g. temperature, competition with other species, food availability). The SS-DBEM projects the impact of changes in the environment (e.g. warming, deoxygenation) and human activity (fishing pressure) on the abundance and biomass of modelled species. All this makes it a state of the art model in regard to projecting fish distribution and trends in both abundance and catch in response to climate change. Model outputs consist of fish abundance (number of fish per grid cell) and fish catch (number of fish caught per grid cell) considering three different fishing activity scenarios, termed the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Whilst the model units are expressed as “Number of individuals”, they are not to be used to predict actual future stocks but rather numbers relative to the initial starting values of the model. This is because the model was not intialised with actual fish numbers and subsequently the significance of this dataset is to show temporal and geographical trends, relative to other years and other grid points, in response to changes in the climate and the applied Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).
